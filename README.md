Hello fellow traders!

The story behind **FX News Radar** begins with a common challenge in trading. Like many of you, I've spent countless hours watching charts, constantly navigating between various financial news websites to understand market sentiment and spot crucial news that could move the market. This constant refreshing and site-hopping became exhausting and, frankly, dizzying.

That's when the idea for **FX News Radar** was born: a tool designed to automatically scan, sort, and instantly display all relevant financial news, often within mere seconds of its release.

What started as a personal project quickly grew into a valuable resource for friends and smaller trading communities. Today, I'm excited to present **Version 61 of the site**, a significantly enhanced iteration. This version delivers impressive performance: market-moving news appears in **10-30 seconds**, while less direct but still important updates reach you in a maximum of **2 minutes**.

#### 3. AI Sentiment: Understand Market Tone

Located conveniently under each article, this feature gives you an immediate understanding of the news's sentiment. It tells you if an article's tone is **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** in relation to the market or a specific asset/currency mentioned. You'll see a clear indication, helping you gauge the general market mood at a glance.

**Important Note:** This feature is **NOT a market prediction tool**. It simply reflects the sentiment expressed *within that news article* and its relevance to a particular asset.

#### 4. AI Market Trend Analysis: Deeper Insights

Want to dive deeper into a specific asset? This powerful function allows you to use AI to analyze a particular currency, asset, or forex pair based on all the news that has appeared throughout the day. Simply input something like "EUR/USD" or "GOLD," and the system scans all relevant daily news to provide you with a concise summary and a clear "StrengthScore" (from 1 to 10) reflecting the overall sentiment and trend derived from the aggregated information.
