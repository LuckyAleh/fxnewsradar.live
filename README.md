## Discover FX News Radar's Powerful Features:

FX News Radar is built to empower your trading decisions with timely and insightful information. It's a straightforward web application designed for clarity and speed, focusing on what you see and interact with.

### Key Features at a Glance:

#### 1. Real-Time Financial News Dashboard

This is the core function. As I mentioned, it automatically scans the most important financial and forex news websites. If an article is relevant, it appears on the dashboard. News with a direct market impact appears in 10-30 seconds, and less direct news within a maximum of 2 minutes (with an average of 1.3 minutes for these).

#### 2. AI Summarize

To make things easier for you, if you're interested in an article or believe it might have a market impact, our AI provides a summary of that news, offering key takeaways and potential implications for the market.

#### 3. AI Sentiment

This feature is available under each article. It provides a direct sentiment about that article in relation to the market and/or the currency/asset mentioned. It offers a conclusion on whether the article's sentiment is Positive, Negative, or Neutral, with a note in parentheses indicating for which currency or asset the sentiment applies, or if it's a general sentiment. **Please note: This does not offer market predictions; it simply shows you the sentiment within that news article and regarding which currency/asset.**

#### 4. AI Market Trend Analysis

With this function, you can use the AI to analyze a specific currency, asset, or forex pair based on the news that has appeared on that day. For example, if you're interested in EUR/USD, it scans all the relevant news from the day and provides a brief summary and a sentiment strength analysis based on that information.

## Built With:

FX News Radar is a modern web application crafted using reliable and widely-used technologies:

* **Frontend:** We use **HTML** for the structure, **CSS** (powered by **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive design) for styling, and **vanilla JavaScript** for all the dynamic features and user interactions you see.

* **News Aggregation:** To ensure you get news quickly and reliably, we utilize a **Cloudflare Worker**. This acts as a smart intermediary, efficiently gathering news from various financial RSS feeds and delivering it directly to your dashboard.
