FX News Radar: Your Real-Time Financial News Dashboard

Access the Live Platform: www.fxnewsradar.live

Hello fellow traders!

The story behind FX News Radar begins with a common challenge in trading. Like many of you, I've spent countless hours watching charts, constantly navigating between various financial news websites to understand market sentiment and spot crucial news that could move the market. This constant refreshing and site-hopping became exhausting and, frankly, dizzying.

That's when the idea for FX News Radar was born: a tool designed to automatically scan, sort, and instantly display all relevant financial news, often within mere seconds of its release.

What started as a personal project quickly grew into a valuable resource for friends and smaller trading communities. Today, I'm excited to present Version 61 of the site, a significantly enhanced iteration. This version delivers impressive performance: market-moving news appears in 10-30 seconds, while less direct but still important updates reach you in a maximum of 2 minutes.
Discover FX News Radar's Powerful Features:

FX News Radar is built to empower your trading decisions with timely and insightful information. It's a straightforward web application designed for clarity and speed, focusing on what you see and interact with.
Key Features at a Glance:
1. Real-Time Financial News Dashboard

This is where all the action happens! Our intuitive dashboard keeps you updated with a constant stream of financial news. You'll see breaking news aggregated from the most important financial and forex sources, all displayed directly on your screen. This ensures you're always informed about market-influencing events as they unfold.
2. AI Summarize: Get the Gist, Fast

Tired of reading long articles? With just a click, our built-in AI summary feature provides concise summaries of any news piece. It quickly extracts the key takeaways and potential market implications, allowing you to grasp the essence of an article instantly, without having to read the full text.
3. AI Sentiment: Understand Market Tone

Located conveniently under each article, this feature gives you an immediate understanding of the news's sentiment. It tells you if an article's tone is Positive, Negative, or Neutral in relation to the market or a specific asset/currency mentioned. You'll see a clear indication, helping you gauge the general market mood at a glance.

Important Note: This feature is NOT a market prediction tool. It simply reflects the sentiment expressed within that news article and its relevance to a particular asset.
4. AI Market Trend Analysis: Deeper Insights

Want to dive deeper into a specific asset? This powerful function allows you to use AI to analyze a particular currency, asset, or forex pair based on all the news that has appeared throughout the day. Simply input something like "EUR/USD" or "GOLD," and the system scans all relevant daily news to provide you with a concise summary and a clear "StrengthScore" (from 1 to 10) reflecting the overall sentiment and trend derived from the aggregated information.
Built With:

FX News Radar is a modern web application crafted using reliable and widely-used technologies:

    Frontend: We use HTML for the structure, CSS (powered by Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design) for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for all the dynamic features and user interactions you see.

    News Aggregation: To ensure you get news quickly and reliably, we utilize a Cloudflare Worker. This acts as a smart intermediary, efficiently gathering news from various financial RSS feeds and delivering it directly to your dashboard.

    Artificial Intelligence: The intelligence behind our summarization, sentiment analysis, and trend analysis features comes from Google's Language Model (LLM) APIs, specifically the Gemma 3-1B-it model. This allows us to process and understand vast amounts of text data to provide you with valuable insights.
